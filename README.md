### Mathematical Statistics in R,

The main textbook followed is: <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Mathematical-Statistics-Duxbury/dp/0534380204'>Bain, L.J. and Engelhardt, M., Introduction to Probability and Mathematical Statistics, Second edition, PWS-Kent, 1991</a>.<br><br>
Computational aspects related to the various chapters studied are dealt with in projects completed in R Markdown. A .pdf output was also generated for each project for easy reference.

| Project | Associated Chapters |

| Project 1 | Chapters 7 and 8 covers limiting and sampling distributions. These are very important results for later chapters and also to understand the behavior (distribution) of certain statistics (functions of random variables). One way to investigate this is to do a simulation study. Most theoretical results can be shown to hold empirically through simulation, and some results that are hard to derive theoretically can be established with simulation.      |
| Project 2 | Chapter 9 presents different frameworks for estimating a parameters with one value i.e. point estimation. The three main methods are MME, MLE and Bayes. In this project you will use a simulation study to see of you can recover the parameter values (when your point estimate is close to the true value) and also use some real data to estimate parameter values or functional forms thereof.      |
| Project 3 | This project is based on the confidence intervals covered in chapter 11 as well as bootstrap confidence intervals. Bootstrapping is a popular statistical technique that allows the estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistics using random sampling methods.     |
| Project 4 | Continuation of topics in Chapter 11      |
